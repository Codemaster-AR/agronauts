# Sensors used - mainly environmental sensors. MKR Carrier sensors:

### The BME688 Environmental 4-in-1 sensor:

Humidity, 0‒100% r.H. - Purpose: VDP scans, increase humidity by turning off the fan (relay) when the plant is a sapling, and reduce humidity during vegitation stage by turning on the fan (relay).

Temperature, -40 to +85 °C. - Turn on the fan to reduce heat when temprature exceeds 28°C and beeps/alerts the user when 31°C or above.

Pressure, 300-1100 hPa. kPa format is also accepted. - For saplings, turn off the fan more regularly to reduce atmospheric pressure for younger plants.

Gas, IAQ, VOC, CO2. - Gas detection for plants alerts the user when there is a lack of C02 for immediate action for plant wellbeing.

### Color, Gesture, and Proximity Sensor
Broadcom APDS-9960 - Colour plant detection, motion detection for air, proximity of plant - plant growth.

### The Motion / IMU Sensor
Model Name (Rev2): LSM6DSOX (6-axis IMU)

Model Name (Original): LSM6DS3 - Checks for waves for switching betweeen screens.

### Touch captive sensors for menu navigation (on the spot)
Users can also use the board directly to see data and choose between menus when they do not have their phone.
