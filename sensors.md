# Sensors used - mainly environmental sensors. MKR Carrier sensors:

### The BME688 Environmental 4-in-1 sensor:

Humidity, 0‒100% r.H. - Purpose: VDP scans, increase humidity by turning off the fan (relay) when the plant is a sapling, and reduce humidity during vegitation stage by turning on the fan (relay).

Temperature, -40 to +85 °C. - Turn on the fan to reduce heat when temprature exceeds 28°C and beeps/alerts the user when 31°C or above.

Pressure, 300-1100 hPa. kPa format is also accepted. - For saplings, turn off the fan more regularly to reduce atmospheric pressure for younger plants.

Gas, IAQ, VOC, CO2. - Gas detection for plants alerts the user when there is a lack of C02 for immediate action for plant wellbeing.
